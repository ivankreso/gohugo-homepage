abstract = "We propose an effective technique to address large scale variation in images taken from a moving car by cross-breeding deep learning with stereo reconstruction. Our main contribution is a novel scale selection layer which extracts convolutional features at the scale which matches the corresponding reconstructed depth. The recovered scale-invariant representation disentangles appearance from scale and frees the pixel-level classifier from the need to learn the laws of the perspective. This results in improved segmentation results due to more efficient exploitation of representation capacity and training data. We perform experiments on two challenging stereoscopic datasets (KITTI and Cityscapes) and report competitive class-level IoU performance."
